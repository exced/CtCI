# Chapter 1 : Arrays and Strings

## Question 1 
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

### Naive implentation

### Optimization

## Question 2
Implement a function void reverse(char* str) in C or C++ which reverses a null-termi-nated string.

First when you have pointer, treat the NULL case.
To reverse you have to know the length of the word.
